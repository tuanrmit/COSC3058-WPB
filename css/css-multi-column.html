        <h1>Basic selectors</h1>
        <div>
            <p>A type selector is sometimes referred to as a tag name selector or element selector because it selects an HTML tag/element in your document. In the example below, we have used the span, em and strong selectors.</p>
            <p>The case-sensitive class selector starts with a dot (.) character. It will select everything in the document with that class applied to it. In the live example below we have created a class called highlight, and have applied it to several places in my document. All of the elements that have the class applied are highlighted.</p>
            <p>The case-sensitive ID selector begins with a # rather than a dot character, but is used in the same way as a class selector. The difference is that an ID can be used only once per page, and elements can only have a single id value applied to them. It can select an element that has the id set on it, and you can precede the ID with a type selector to only target the element if both the element and ID match.</p>
